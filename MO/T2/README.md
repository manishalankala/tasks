Running a Maltego TRX Server
Task 2

```
In Maltego Operations, you are asked to run a Maltego TRX Server as a Docker Container on Azure
and fully automate the installation.
• To do this, you will have to develop a program/script in the language of your choice which will
execute the deployment. However, the prerequisite is the use of Terraform (recommended) and/or
the Azure CLI and that the program/script installs all dependencies and requirements on the
deployment machine and can therefore be executed by an arbitrarily selected machine. The
execution of the script should finish when everything is up and running.
• In order to be able to fulfill the task, a repository for the Docker container and related credentials is
provided.
• Present the deployed script to the team.
The TRX Server and the documentation you can find here: https://github.com/paterva/maltego-trx
